## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning (ML) is a modern software development technique and a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data. It allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.


Machine learning is part of the broader field of artificial intelligence. This field is concerned with the capability of machines to perform activities using human-like intelligence. Within machine learning there are several different kinds of tasks or techniques:

* In **supervised learning**, every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values. We will explore this in-depth in this lesson.
* In **unsupervised learning**, there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data. We will explore this in-depth in this lesson.
* In **reinforcement learning**, the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal. This is a completely different approach than supervised and unsupervised learning. We will dive deep into this in the next lesson.

## How does machine learning differ from traditional programming-based approaches?

## Understanding Terminology

Machine learning is a new field created at the intersection of statistics, applied math, and computer science. Because of the rapid and recent growth of machine learning, each of these fields might use slightly different formal definitions of the same terms.

## Components of Machine Learning

Nearly all tasks solved with machine learning involve three primary components:

* A machine learning model
* A model training algorithm
* A model inference algorithm

## Clay Analogy for Machine Learning

You can understand the relationships between these components by imagining the stages of crafting a teapot from a lump of clay.

1. First, you start with a block of raw clay. At this stage, the clay can be molded into many different forms and be used to serve many different purposes. You decide to use this lump of clay to make a teapot.
2. So how do you create this teapot? You inspect and analyze the raw clay and decide how to change it to make it look more like the teapot you have in mind.
3. Next, you mold the clay to make it look more like the teapot that is your goal.
Congratulations! You've completed your teapot. You've inspected the materials, evaluated how to change them to reach your goal, and made the changes, and the teapot is now ready for your enjoyment.

Congratulations! You've completed your teapot. You've inspected the materials, evaluated how to change them to reach your goal, and made the changes, and the teapot is now ready for your enjoyment.

## What are machine learning models?

A machine learning model, like a piece of clay, can be molded into many different forms and serve many different purposes. A more technical definition would be that a machine learning model is a block of code or framework that can be modified to solve different but related problems based on the data provided.

## Model Training
#### How are model training algorithms used to train a model?
In the preceding section, we talked about two key pieces of information: a model and data. In this section, we show you how those two pieces of information are used to create a trained model. This process is called model training.

#### Model training algorithms work through an interactive process
Let's revisit our clay teapot analogy. We've gotten our piece of clay, and now we want to make a teapot. Let's look at the algorithm for molding clay and how it resembles a machine learning algorithm:

* **Think about the changes that need to be made**. The first thing you would do is inspect the raw clay and think about what changes can be made to make it look more like a teapot. Similarly, a model training algorithm uses the model to process data and then compares the results against some end goal, such as our clay teapot.
* **Make those changes**. Now, you mold the clay to make it look more like a teapot. Similarly, a model training algorithm gently nudges specific parts of the model in a direction that brings the model closer to achieving the goal.
* **Repeat**. By iterating over these steps over and over, you get closer and closer to what you want until you determine that youâ€™re close enough that you can stop.

#### Model Inference: Using Your Trained Model
Now you have our completed teapot. You inspected the clay, evaluated the changes that needed to be made, and made them, and now the teapot is ready for you to use. Enjoy your tea!

So what does this mean from a machine learning perspective? We are ready to use the model inference algorithm to generate predictions using the trained model. This process is often referred to as model inference.
